# rl_environments
A list of reinforcement learning Environments:
- LinearChain (standard)
- messed up linear chain (inspired from the "Vanishing gradient example" given in Chapter 12, Agarwal et al. 2019)
- DotReacher (proposed by Rupam Mahmood; code modified from Rupam Mahmood and Gautham Vasan)
- CliffWorld (variation of Example 6.6, Sutton and Barto, 2018; code modified from Simone Totaro)
